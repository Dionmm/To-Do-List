## Hey frontend!

 I'm creating this file to let you know how to contact database and receive answers for queries.


 Every request need to go to /data - you will receive an **object** back!

 1. If you send request to /data without parameters - you will get whole database

 2. If you send a request to /data with **id** parameter, you will get specify entry (ex. **/data?id=3**)

 3. Check for **.length** of returning object, to know how many entries are in DB!


 Later on, we will more queries options add POST stuff!



 ## Thanks!
